# ADM_Homework5

This is the group 21 and it is composed by:
  - Ulviyya Jafarli 
  - Alexandr Melnic
  - Silviu Spac

1. __`func_1.py`__:
	> Given an initial node and a distance, it plots a subgraph containing the initial node and all the nodes up to the selected distance 

2. __`func_2.py`__:
	> Given a set of nodes it finds the MST through the Kruskal algorithm that contains all those nodes.

3. __`func_3.py`__:
	> Given a set of nodes it computes the shortest path passing for all the nodes in order.

4. __`func_4.py`__:
	> Given a set of nodes it computes the shortest walk passing for all the nodes not necesserily in order.

5. __`get_data.py`__:
	> Functions used to create the networkx graph, than we save it in a pickle file

6. __`fibonacci_heap.py`__:
	> we modified fibonaci_heap_mode to keep track of the nodes saved in the heap

5. __`main.py`__:
	> Script that executes the whole system and it imports all the previous files

	> It takes in input 1 argument (1, 2, 3, or 4), the functionality you want to run

	> Ex to run it: python main.py 3
